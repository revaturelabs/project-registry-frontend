# This pipeline relies on the analysis.ng.yml and dockerize.ng.yml templates 
# located in the repository resource descibed below.  Note that these are
# distinct from analysis.mvn.yml and dockerize.mvn.yml, which are for maven builds.
# The ref: value must point to a branch where both templates exist.

# This pipeline will trigger on commits or pull-requests made to the branch-dev 
# or main branches.  Note that complete static analysis with SonarCloud is only 
# performed on "long-lived" branches, designated as 'main' and any branch name 
# prefixed with 'branch-'.  A minimal analysis is still performed on "short-lived" 
# branches, and a special analysis is performed on pull requests.

- branch-dev

# These variable groups are required for sonarCloud and Discord secrets to be
# available for analysis tasks
# The contents of these groups that are used here are:
#  project-registry-sonarcloud: stores sonarcloud variables/secrets
#   - sonarKeyPrefix: the common prefix string for the sonar keys in the project
#       (requires a sonarCloud project key)
#   - sonarNamePrefix: the common prefix string for the project names
#   - sonarOrg: the sonar organization
#   - sonarUrlPrefix: the common prefix string for the url for the results
#  project-registry-discord: stores discord variables/secrets
#   - discordAnalysisChannel: the output channel for discord analysis info
#   - discordAnalysisKey: the webhook key associated with the above channel
variables:
# secrets
